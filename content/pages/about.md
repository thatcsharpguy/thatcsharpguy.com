#### Antonio Feregrino  
Programmer, eager to teach but more to learn. Passionate about what I do, I wrote my first calculator in C# back in 2008 and I haven't stopped since then. It took me 6 years to finish the university while writing code at Heurística Soluciones. I used to be a Microsoft Student Partner and first generation member of the Xamarin Student Partners, I have got a nice trophy from Xamarin which says that I'm a certified mobile developer.

**This is important: While I love C#, I have alwyas believed that the most important thing is to have great ideas and to know how to express them, the language isn't as important.**
